# Power-Platform-Gift-Declaration-Solution
A solution I developed using the Power Platform as part of a "Boot Camp" program to get Microsoft Certified in the Power Platform App Maker Associate (PL-100) and Power Platform Fundamentals (PL-900).

# Requirements/Business Rules
### The gift declaration form for received gifts must capture the following details:
- The date the gift is received
- Received the gift from who
- Department of the person receiving the gift
- Gift's estimated monetary value – how much the gift costs
- User must attach an image and/or offer a written description about the gift.

### The gift declaration form for sent gifts must capture the following details:
- Who is the gift being given to
- Who gave the gift
- The department of the person sending the gift
- Reasoning/s for sending the gift
- Gift’s monetary value
- A file containing Vendor quotes for the gift - mandatory to provide a file attachment with 3 invoices.

### Employees needs to confirm they have read the business’s Gift Policy documentation prior to submission. There must be a clickable link to the Gift policy.

### After detail have been captured and submitted:
-	The Department manager is to get notified of the gift declaration and the details captured in the declaration, given that the monetary value of the gift is below a set threshold amount – the set amount for this scenario was R2000 (est. $114).
-	The Department manager can then choose to approve the declaration or reject it.
-	If rejected, the Department manager needs to provide reasoning for the rejection as well as actions for the requestor on what to do with the gift.
-	The requestor is to be notified of both the reasoning as well as required actions to dispose of the gift if declaration is rejected.
-	The requestor then needs to confirm the recommended actions have been taken within a 1-week period, failure in doing so, their department manager is to be notified.
-	If the requestor is a department manager/Director or Chief Executive Officer, the declaration will automatically be sent to the Gift Committee for approval. If rejected, reasoning as well as recommended actions are mandatory.
-	If the gift’s monetary value is above the set threshold amount – currently R2000 (est. $114), it will become mandatory to provide proof of the gift via an attachment (picture) along with the declaration. The declaration will automatically be sent to the Gift Committee for approval, skipping the manager approval process.
-	Gift Committee approval or rejection can be provided by ANY individual within the committee and does not require everybody in the committee to approve/reject.
-	If required, the user can resubmit the item with new details after being rejected given the recommended action has been completed.
-	An overview containing analytics for declarations submitted where you can filter by department, gift type, company, or individual employee.
